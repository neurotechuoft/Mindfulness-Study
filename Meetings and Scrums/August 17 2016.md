Definitions of meditation

- Aatina: about 4--5 different types of meditation in Wiki; 

- Allen: what type of meditation, technique should we focus on

    - we should choose focus-awareness meditation
    
	- choosing TM (a subset of focus-awareness meditation) gives more restrictive rules for meditation

- Aatina: lots of studies have been done on biofeedback for meditation

	- usually the feedback displays a sound or image as an indicator of meditative state; we should do that too

- Jackie: we should add a spirituality component as well

	- ie: self-awareness, self-love connection to environment, etc

- how to give the feedback?

	- instead of warnings, play a mantra?
	
		- Allen: but then you're associating meditation with 

- in the end: do focus-based meditation

- physiological, neurological factors
	
	- autonomous nervous system switches from sympathetic to parasympathetic
	
	-'pure consciousness' heavily correlates with decreased respiratory rate, oxy. consumption
	
	- increased alpha, theta wave activity
	
	- increased GSR response -- forward this article to James

- James: we have stage 1, stage 2

	- doesn't tell us how they move from normal state to meditative state

		- how can we help them transition?

		- barriers to transitioning?
		
	

- Montreal

  - Jackie, Allen, not Aatina

- Goal of next meeting:

	- find out how do people move from a normal state to a meditative state

	- what barriers do they experience

	- how strong of an indicator each physiological/neurological response is
	
		- minimum # of factors tht will give most accurate model
		
		- difficulty of measuring each one

	- possibly brainstorm intervention mechanisms to help get past barriers
